# Rick and Morty App
This project is a web application that utilizes the Rick and Morty API to provide various functionalities such as searching for characters, filtering, adding to favorites, removing from favorites, and a login system to access the app.

## Created and desinged by me! Agustin Nazer ;)

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your local machine:

Node.js (version 12 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:


## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rick-and-morty-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd rick-and-morty-app

3. Install the dependencies:
npm install


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

 ### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload whenever you make changes to the code.<br>
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about running tests for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

### `npm run eject`

### Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready for it.
